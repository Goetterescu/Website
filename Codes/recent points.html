<br><h3>Protocol:</h3>
<p>The suspect almost sideswiped the left side of my vehicle and drove off. While doing so he managed to detach his rear bumper at a curb 
(I am not sure about where and how it happened, but that's my guess). He also drove around and jumped the curb when he exited the 
roundabout near the spawn in mitcity. The suspect eddy behaved like a street racer before and after those incidents. 
The report has been recorded by me, so there is no need to approve it.<br>The infractions of this case are both stated in ยง18 of the BTL.
