<br><h3>Protocol:</h3>
<p>The suspect started his series of crimes by driving on the wrong side of the road. This can be seen in image one. He then switched his 
vehicle and started ramming my duty vehicle. He jumped with his monster truck at least two times over the police car (images two and three). 
After a second car switch, he started speeding on the area of the gas station. He lost control and jumped a curb, which almost ended fatal. 
See image four as proof. The suspect drove away from the gas station right after the incident. He made an illegal U-turn over a lane (image 
five) and provoked an accident with another traffic member. The other traffic member was "Takumi". 
I can only proof the wreck with image number six. It might look like "Takumi" switched the lane and caused the wreck, which is false. 
The accident occurred because of the excessive speed which the suspect had. There is no way "Takumi" could have seen and prevented the crash. 
The fact that my suspect ignored the wreck makes the whole case worse.<br>I want to point out that every suspect is allowed to appeal 
against cases. As an staff member, there is no need for other moderators to verify this report.<br>
I'm giving "not player" two points for excessive speeding, one for driving in the wrong direction, two for damaging 
other people's property (including the police dp. vehicle) and two for driving recklessly (&sect;18).

<br><h3>Protocol:</h3>
<p>The suspect was followed by me during a patrolling tour, after he started to become noticeable. The cause of this was mainly his speeding. 
I tried to catch up with TankurfaceJr and had to speed, too. Even when reaching 50mph, I could not catch up on the suspect. 
He (seemingly) spun out on purpose twice. I did not stop the suspect. I tried to talk to him on a loading area (deposit) and he complied. 
His answer to why he was driving like that was something about "I don't know where's the next race track". He was driving careful after my warning. 
He still endangered (possible) pedestrians. This report was filled out by an Moderator.<br>I'm requesting one point for speeding, two for 
driving recklessly (&sect;18) and one more point for driving into the wrong direction (after his spinout in the exit of the roundabout).

<br><h3>Protocol:</h3>
<p>The suspect hit the front end of my unmarked police car after merging into the right hand side of the road. This happened after his 
attempt to overtake me. There was no obvious reason to overtake me. After hitting my car he drove off without checking for other traffic. 
Both cars did not sustain enough damage to use it as material for this case. There is only one image which cannot really proof the crash. 
I want to point out that the suspect is allowed to appeal against this case, either by his own or with the help of someone else. I am 
requesting one point for each infraction. One for crashing into my duty vehicle and another one for Greg Salk's reckless driving.

<br><h3>Protocol:</h3>
<p>The suspect has been blocked by other officers for an unknown reason. Officer zurkhal stated that the suspect drove on the wrong side of the 
main road, that might a reason for the pursuit on which I did not participate. I noticed the blockage and arthur's damaged vehicle, so I decided 
to join in. The suspect did not stop his car when I asked him to do so. I had to ram his vehicle in order to make him park his car. He did 
not comply with other officers or with me and put other people in danger. I am requesting two points for reckless driving (&sect;18) and two 
more for damaging other cars and not stopping when asked.

<br><h3>Protocol:</h3>
<p>The suspect attracted by attention because he almost hit me after I stopped to set up my speed camera. I followed him and noticed that 
he was clearly speeding, because I could not reach him when doing 47mph. He also risked his own life, and the one of others (&sect;18) when 
he lost control over his car. I'm requesting two points for reckless driving and one for speeding.
