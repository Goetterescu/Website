<br><h3>Protocol:</h3>
<p>The suspect almost sideswiped the left side of my vehicle and drove off. While doing so he managed to detach his rear bumper at a curb 
(I am not sure about where and how it happened, but that's my guess). He also drove around and jumped the curb when he exited the 
roundabout near the spawn in mitcity. The suspect eddy behaved like a street racer before and after those incidents. 
The report has been recorded by me, so there is no need to approve it.<br>The infractions of this case are both stated in &sect;18 of the BTL.

<br><h3>Protocol:</h3>
<p>I drove to the scene of an accident and had to drive a suspect to the police station in mitcity, in order to interview him and inform the 
suspect about what will happen to him and his case. The case would be handled by his insurance company, 
so there is no need to report it here. When I backed up on the right lane of the main road (heading to the north), I caused a wreck. I didn't 
check what's behind me and saw the vehicle behind me way too late. I did not manage to break in time. The damage will be handled by my 
insurance company. I reported myself, so there is no need for a judge. No one was injured.<br>The violated law is only &sect;2 of the BTL. &sect;11 
is not relevant because of my role as a police officer.
