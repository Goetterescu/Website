<br><h3>Protocol:</h3>
<p>The suspect started his series of crimes by driving on the wrong side of the road. This can be seen in image one. He then switched his 
vehicle and started ramming my duty vehicle. He jumped with his monster truck at least two times over the police car (images two and three). 
After a second car switch, he started speeding on the area of the gas station. He lost control and jumped a curb, which almost ended fatal. 
See image four as proof. The suspect drove away from the gas station right after the incident. He made an illegal U-turn over a lane (image 
five) and provoked an accident with another traffic member. The other traffic member was "Takumi". 
I can only proof the wreck with image number six. It might look like "Takumi" switched the lane and caused the wreck, which is false. 
The accident occurred because of the excessive speed which the suspect had. There is no way "Takumi" could have seen and prevented the crash. 
The fact that my suspect ignored the wreck makes the whole case worse.<br>I want to point out that every suspect is allowed to appeal 
against cases. As an staff member, there is no need for other moderators to verify this report.<br>
I'm giving "not player" two points for excessive speeding, one for driving in the wrong direction, two for damaging 
other people's property (including the police dp. vehicle) and two for driving recklessly (&sect;18).
