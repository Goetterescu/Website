<details class="eventsum"><summary class="eventsum-st">Week one:</summary>
<p>The first race of the Championship will take place on the F1 Testtrack. The racetrack itself makes driving 
on that weekend really easy. Caution should be taken after the last corner. This is the place where new Players will drop and maybe even 
spawn new vehicles. This situation can summon preventable crashes, but the Moderators can't always stop this from happening.</p>

<h3>Moderators</h3>
<p>Moderators should make themselves a note containing a table. This table should be used to write down every lap of each Player.<br>
Moderators are also present to protect the Event against vandalism and such. Players are allowed to be banned instantly if they're not 
listening to the Moderators. Players have to follow the Event rules and Moderators are there to enforce the rules. We want a nicely 
organized and calm Event. This requires the Moderators of this server to be active and responsive.<br>Moderators are asked to send 
the lap times to Trucker_Gigi, even if they can be "simply looked up on the website". All Staff is asked to respect other Players 
and their role.</p>
