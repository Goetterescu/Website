You will start with a single round qualification. You can do this one twice per week.

The time will determine your starting position. You will start on the pole position if you're good enough.

After the qualification you will start either on the three or single round race. This will be decided by the Mods.

The other race will be held right after the first one.

You're allowed to do the single round race as often as the Mods allow you to.

Your position from the single and from the three round race will be used to determine your current weeks position. 
Please note that Players who did not finish or missed out, will share the same position on the race Leaderboard.
Otherwise we could not do the math for every week.

The average positon of each week will result in the Leaderboard for the Moonshine Cup. 
That's the endscore, which will determine the winner.

If you want to be the winner at the end of the Championship, you have to race on every weekend!

Actually pretty easy, isn't it?
