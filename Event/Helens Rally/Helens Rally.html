<h3>General:</h3>
<p>Players can vote if they want to. Otherwise the active Moderator will decide which stage will be used next. 
Judges (Moderators) will be active as often as possible. The Judges will enforce the 
rules, give a countdown for the start (using Beholder) and take the times of the drivers. 
The times will be inserted into the Leaderboard, which will be posted on the website on Monday.</p><hr>

<h3>Stage three:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Start at the beginning of the tarmac road next to the airfield (south-east of coldwater)
</li><li>Launch in direction of coldwater/castle
</li><li>Drive straight and go past the two intersections (castle and the docks)
</li><li>Stay left and follow the road in direction of coldwater
</li><li>Finish by crossing the inside line (looking from coldwater it's the road marking on the left) next to coldwater</li></ul>
<br><p>This stage is known by racers who participated in the past. But this time it's reversed and on another version of this map. 
Drivers should pay attention. The road seems to be good and pretty much straight, but that is the real danger. 
Don't accelerate too hard!</p>

<h3>Stage four:</h3>
<p>This one does not need Beholder. We will be using the official time stamps, because we are going to use the official track for this stage. 
Easy to understand. Moderators will be obligated to use the time stamps shown by the website and are only allowed to extend the time when 
necessary (penalties or similar). There are special rules for this stage:</p>
<ul>
<li>§1<br>Respawning is not allowed. Players are asked to not even attempt a sneaky try! The game will notice it and abort your race.</li>
<li>§2<br>Nodegrabbing is allowed only 10 seconds after a flip or similar. Players have to call the flip for the Moderators. The Moderators 
will then allow the Player after about 10 seconds to use nodegrabbing. Nodegrabbing is not allowed to be used to create any advantage.</li>
<li>§3<br>Excessive ramming is not allowed. Collisions have to be turned on.</li>
