<h3>General:</h3>
<p>As you know from the rules, there will be three stages which we are going to use. Players can vote if they want to. Otherwise the active 
Moderator will decide which stage will be used next. Judges (Moderators) will be active as often as possible. The Judges will enforce the 
rules, give a countdown for the start (using Beholder) and take the times of the drivers. 
The times will be inserted into the Leaderboard, which will be posted on the website on Monday.</p><hr>

<h3>Stage one:</h3>
<p>Stage one is pretty rough, mainly because of the roads and length. 
There are also a two turning points, which won't be your friends.</p>

<h3>Stage three:</h3>
<p>This is a standard track and good for lazy drivers who are not in the mood to visit the website and read this. 
It's simple: Use the default rally track of Helens. Beware of potholes and sand. Special rules: Players will start with a gap of about 
30 seconds. The times listed on the RoR-Website will be used on the Leaderboard.</p>
