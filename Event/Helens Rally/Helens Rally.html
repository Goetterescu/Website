<h3>General:</h3>
<p>Players can vote if they want to. Otherwise the active Moderator will decide which stage will be used next. 
Judges (Moderators) will be active as often as possible. The Judges will enforce the 
rules, give a countdown for the start (using Beholder) and take the times of the drivers. 
The times will be inserted into the Leaderboard, which will be posted on the website on Monday.</p><hr>

<h3>Stage three:</h3>
<img class="center" width="50%" src="Helens Rally/track.png">
<br><ul>
<li>Start at the beginning of the tarmac road next to the airfield (south-east of coldwater)
</li><li>Launch in direction of coldwater/castle
</li><li>Drive straight and go past the two intersections (castle and the docks)
</li><li>Stay left and follow the road in direction of coldwater
</li><li>Finish by crossing the inside line (looking from coldwater it's the road marking on the left) next to coldwater</li></ul>
<br><p>This stage is known by racers who participated in the past. But this time it's reversed and on another version of this map. 
Drivers should pay attention. The road seems to be good and pretty much straight, but that is the real danger. 
Don't accelerate too hard!</p>

<h3>Stage four:</h3>
<p>This one is a classic stage. Some of you might remember it. Players will start at the intersection next to coldwater. The finish line 
will be the end of the road at the docks.</p>
