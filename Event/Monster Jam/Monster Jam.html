<details class="eventsum"><summary class="eventsum-st">Event Rules:</summary>
<p>Please read those carefully and remind other Players to respect these.</p>
<ul>
<li>§1<br>The stadium is allowed to be used by the participants only. Also only one Player at a time will have the right to use the terrain
of the stadium for his performance. Not even Moderators are allowed to interfere with the drivers!</li>
<li>§2<br>Every driver will have five minutes for warmup, ten minutes for his freestyle performance and a maximum of one minute to leave
the area of the stadium.<ul>
<li>§2.1<br>Definition of warmup: The driver will be allowed to use the whole stadium to inspect the area and set up his obstacles.
The driver can use this time to line up for his performance.</li>
<li>§2.2<br>Drivers can do whatever trick they want to show, as long as he's not endangering other people. Ramming the sides of the
grandstand, even if there is an accident, will result in an abortion of the run. The jury will decide if the 
already earned points will be recorded or not.</li>
<li>§2.3<br>The jury will inform the current participant about his time and tell him when his time is over. At this point: Please make
room for the next Player!</li></ul></li>
<li>§3<br>Moderators have the right to enforce the rules by kicking or temporarily bann Players. I don't want this to happen, 
so please don't mess with the Event and/or other Players.</li>
<li>§4<br>The Jury has to inform the Player about every point of his run. Like "You have 7 for perf., 7 ind. and 8 for madn.".
Every Driver has the right to know his score!</li>
<li>§5<br>Respawning or repairing is not allowed. If a Player managed to flip his Truck he'll have about 10 seconds to
get his vehicle back on four wheels. If not, the run will be declared as "over".</li>
<li>§6<br>Only allowed content can be used during the Event.</li>
</ul></details>

<h3>Points:</h3>
<p>
The points will be calculated as followed: 3 marks from 1 to 10 will be given by each jury 
for Performance, Individuality and "Madness". The average of these 3 and the followed average of every jury will result
in the end score. This end score will be the points which you'll see on the scoreboard the next day.<br>
The jury will decide the order in which the drivers will start. They will also tell them the points after each run. Every Player
will have two chances.</p><hr>
<h3 style="text-align:center">Quick example of the end score calculation:</h3><p>
Jury 1: 5p;7p;6p<br>
Jury 2: 7p;8p;7p<br><br>
Points from Jury 1: (5+7+6)/3 = 6<br>
Points from Jury 1: (7+8+7)/3 = 7,3<br><br>
End score: (6+7,3)/2 = 6,65<br><br>So the example Player would get 6,65 points, which is pretty good.
