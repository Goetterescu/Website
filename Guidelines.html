<!-- Rules -->
<a name="r"/>
<h3>Main rules:</h3>
<p> Some rules may repeat themselves in different guidelines. I will edit this page over time.</p>
<ul>
<li>§1<br>All Players on the server have to follow the guidelines.</li>
<li>§2<br>It's not allowed to roleplay more than one role at a time.</li>
<li>§3<br>Switching between different roles during a short period of time is forbidden.</li>
<li>§4<br>Roleplaying emergency services should be treated with respect. Those roles require a bigger amount of knowledge about everything 
compared to other roles.</li>
<li>§5<br>Emergency services have the right of way on any road and intersection. This requires them to make themselves noticeable. 
Either with special lights or horns.</li>
<li>§6<br>Emergency services have the right to stop other Players from driving.</li>
<li>§7<br>Public transportations are allowed to park on the roadside, if they're not obstructing the traffic flow.</li>
<li>§8<br>Truck Drivers have the right to use any public parking lot to load/unload.</li>
<li>§9<br>Emergency services are allowed to park on the road if required.</li>
<li>§10<br>Some roles require Players to announce the start of a shift. In this case, Players are allowed to roleplay 
only after using a special command.</li>
<li>§11.1<br>The points system can be used to report traffic violations via the form on this website.<ul>
<li>§11.2<br>All traffic violation reports have to be checked by Moderators.</li>
<li>§11.3<br>Police officers have to keep the proof images or videos until the end of the month. This way they can defend themselves, if the 
suspect tries to proof that he did nothing wrong.</li>
<li>§11.4<br>Points will be set to zero at the end of the month.</li>
<li>§11.5<br>Points will be set to zero when a Player finished his sentence, which is a 24 hour ban.</li>
<li>§11.6<br>An amount of ten points will get Players banned.</li>
<li>§11.7<br>All approved reports have to be documented on the "recent violations" page until the end of the month.</li>
<li>§11.8.1<br>Police officers are allowed to ignore §12 of the BTL, 
if they are using a <a href="https://forum.rigsofrods.org/resources/small-car-trailer.382/">camera trailer</a> or unmarked police car. 
Players can either use the <a href="https://forum.rigsofrods.org/resources/1999-ford-crown-victoria.147/">Ford</a> 
or the <a href="https://forum.rigsofrods.org/resources/gavril-omega-det.591/">Gavril</a>.<ul>
<li>§11.8.2<br>Both are allowed to be used for fining speeding Players. But Players have to pass the trailer/car of the officer.</li>
<li>§11.8.3<br>They can also be used for patrolling or other cases than speeding. But note that judges might dismiss your report.</ul>
<li>§11.9<br>Moderators do have to check all reports made by civilians (even by Moderators). 
Only police reports by Moderators can be ignored. In other words: Police reports by Moderators don't have to be checked, but civilian reports 
made by Moderators have to be checked by <u>another Moderator</u>.</ul>
<li>§12<br>These rules can be changed by Moderators at all times.</li>
</ul><hr>

<!-- Points -->
<a name="po"/>
<h3>Points:</h3>
<p>Players can feel the consequences of being fined by police officers. Let me introduce you to our points system.<br> 
Police officers have the right to report traffic members which are committing infractions against the BTL or role guidelines. 
Every paragraph of the BTL or the respective role guideline can and will get you fined, if necessary. 
Players who are roleplaying the police are asked to send us an image as proof, 
the rules which were broken and the names of the officer and player. Officers and civilians can send us 
the report using the <a href="points/Points.html">forms here</a>. Moderators will approve reports on 
the Discord server and post the current amount of points collected by Players. A single infraction can get you more than one point. 
Example: doing 70 in a 50 zone will result in one point, but excessive speeding might result in two or more points. 
Points are getting reset at the end of each Month. Getting ten points or more will result in a temporary ban for 24 hours. 
This will also reset the points to zero. <br>This 
way we can control the traffic on our server. It's an rp server, this means that you should act like in real life.

<a name="justice"/>
<h3>Justice:</h3>
<p>Please read the <a href="#po">points system article first</a>, before this. Otherwise you might not understand everything in here.<br>
Players can appeal against cases (traffic violation reports). Please note that a few requirements have to be met first.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Player who wants to appeal against a case has to be either the lawyer of the suspect or the suspect himself.</li>
<li>The target case has to be still active. This means that only cases which have been submitted during the current month 
can be appeal against in the respective month.</li>
<li>A judge, which would be any Moderator, should be active.</li>
<li>Same goes for the reporter or officer who reported the suspect.</li>
</ul>
<p>Only if the requirements above are met, Players can appeal against a case. But there are rules to be followed. They can be found here 
and can be addressed as "Crime Handling Ruleset" or CHR. Please mind reading them:</p>
<ul>
<li>§1<br>The judge has to be an experienced Player who knows the BTL, VCG and CHR.</li>
<li>§2.1<br>Court hearings must not be arranged. Lawyers/Players and the judge are not allowed to have a discussion related to the case 
outside of the court.<ul>
<li>§2.2<br>Court hearings are only allowed to be attempted by the suspect, his lawyer (if present) and the judge. Interviews can be held 
after the hearing.</li>
<li>§2.3<br>The judge must be a Player who knows the case and the guidelines.</li>
<li>§2.4<br>The lawyer must be a Player who knows the case and the guidelines.</li></ul>
<li>§3<br>The case can only be dismissed by decision of the judge.</li>
<li>§4.1<br>The case can only be dismissed if it's false or not containing enough proof. The judge has to publish the respective 
paragraph when he is dismissing a case. Please read the paragraphs below.<ul>
<li>§4.2<br>False information can dismiss a case.</li>
<li>§4.3<br>Scam can dismiss a case.</li>
<li>§4.4<br>False or missing proof can dismiss a case.</li></ul>
<li>§5<br>Every case can be appealed against only once. A failed appeal will be marked in the recent violations page.</li>
<li>§6<br>An already dismissed case cannot be turned in again. The points will be removed forever.</li>
<li>§7<br>Moderations will be forced to confront Players who misused this system. 
This will happen if rules from §1 and §2 are being violated.</li>
<li>§8<br>Additional rules can be created if necessary. This way we can ensure that justice will be served the right way.</li>
<li>§9.1<br>Suspects can enter the court hearing by themselves or with one lawyer.<ul>
<li>§9.2<br>The court room can also be entered by the lawyer without the suspect.</li>
<li>§9.3<br>The reporter or officer <u>can</u> be present during the court hearing and is allowed to speak up.</li></ul>
<li>§10<br>Violation points can be transferred between Players.</li>
</ul>
