          <h4 style="text-align: center;">Baker Ranch Highway-Guard Safety</h4>
          <p style="text-align: left;">This test was done by an experienced
            driver and member of this company. No one was put in danger during
            this test!</p>
          <hr>
          <p><b>Preparation:</b></p>
          <p>The area has been cleared of any
            civilians. We removed the wrecked vehicle and debris after the test.</p>
          <p>A standard BMW, which is often seen on
            our public roads, has been used for this test. The vehicle is a good
            reference for most used cars.</p>
          <p>The highway of Baker Ranch has been used
            for this test.</p>
			<p>The tests have been done at around 60 km/h.</p>
          <hr>
          <p style="text-align: left;"><b>Used Object:</b></p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">We used an standard BMW E36 as mentioned
            above. We tested the guardrail of the highway on multiple spots.</p>
          <hr>
          <p style="text-align: left;"><b>Intention:</b></p>
          <p style="text-align: left;">We wanted to proof how safe the
            guardrails are. The guardrails are not usual rails of metal, but
            concrete slabs which can be seen next to other rather poorly made
            roads, in other regions/countries. These concrete guards are known
            for flipping vehicles when they're being forced under a vehicle.
            Most A and B-pillars can not handle the stress of a crash, in which
            the vehicle flips and collapses onto it's own roof. We want to show
            how dangerous the guards are.</p>
          <hr>
          <p><b>Tests:</b></p>
          <p>A total of four tests have been done.</p>
		  <ul>
		  <li>Small input: The car has been launched and accelerated to around 60 km/h. After reaching that speed, it contacted the guard with 
		  no steering input and at a flat angle.</li>
		  <li>Normal input: Same as the above but with a bigger attack angle and light steering input (direction of the guard).</li>
		  <li>High input: Same speed. The car drove along on the outside lane and quickly steered to the right, crossed the inside lane and collided 
		  with the guard.</li>
		  <li>Second high input: Same as above but in slow mo. We tried to see how the roll happened.</li>
		  </ul>
