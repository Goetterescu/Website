<h1>Trucker Gigi</h1>

    <h2>My Character</h2>
    <p> Age: around 30<br>
        Gender: male<br>
        Jobs: Trucker, Driving Instructor (Tier two prefered), leader of the DOTAS<br><br>
        Gigi is an fairly expirienced truck driver. He is usually driving semis or hooklifts. 
        He can get frustrated really quickly and itâ€™s not easy for police officers to catch him. 
        He knows his job and the responsibility that come with it. He knows the BTL and is also an driving instructor. 
        You will find him in south Mitcity. That is the place where he is living and also working, as a freelancer. 
        He has created his own company recently. This company is the DOTAS (Department of traffic and safety). 
        It is linking very well with his other two jobs. There is no doubt, that he knows the traffic rules and you will always see him on the road. 
        Over one million kilometers and still going strong!

    <h2>Favorite Mods</h2>
    <p>I am usually driving the BMW Sedan as my civil car. The Merc Actros series and some other more diverse trucks are my every-day-buddys. I can not say which truck is 
        my favorite, there are just too many. I am also helping out the police sometimes, this means that I am more limited to what I am driving on duty.
