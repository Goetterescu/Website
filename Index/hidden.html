<h2>My "Complicated" Life and the Server</h2>
    <p>
        I came up with the idea for this server around the end of 2019, maybe even sooner. I wanted to become the leader of something cool some day (I don’t know if this server is cool or not, but it has been up for almost one year now and I think that this is quite a solid feature of my recent life).
<br><br>
It started around (now I have to guess) 2014, when I bought a game that changed my life. It was GTA San Andreas and I loved it! Don’t get me wrong, I still love it but I stopped playing it. I was never a fan of mods or multiplayer games. A lonely life was just the right thing. I have experienced a lot of sadness during my many online gaming sessions. One day I experienced something really great. I found a german role playing server for my GTA game. I really loved it. I was just a kid and had the chance to experience the life of an adult, with all the problems included. They had licenses for guns and cars, factions, rules for traffic, a good (and kinda corrupt) market and currency system and much much more! I was thrilled as fuck and had a very good time. One day, I stopped playing it. I don’t know why and I miss the times that I had on that server. 
<br><br>
I wanted to play on it again after quite some time and had to witness pure sadness… the server was gone. I am not sure why, but I guess that they had too few players and just dried out. But I found a new one and had a similar, but not so strong experience on it. It was cool, but not the same. I really learned to respect every single member and contributor, because it is really a pain in the ass to modify a game or to create a community like that (for a “dead game”). I lost my motivation to play the game after becoming a full licensed truck driver. I went back to check who’s online for a few times since I left. It is always the same people. The big and popular members are online, but just AFK and earning EXP by being “active” on the server. This is sad in my opinion. 
<br><br>
I played many role-playing games and I am honestly not happy with myself and how life got me so far. I am an alcoholic smoker, who has the shittiest grades anyone has ever seen, I am a bad human in general and everything that is going remotely wrong in my life can make me just dumb everything right away. I feel like I don’t even need to exist. I am suffering since almost one year, now I am diagnosed with depression and I am slowly loosing my mind. 
<br><br>
Back to the server: the above is why I like role-playing (mostly online). I can keep safe distance from others and someone else. Role-playing is about your mind, you have to believe in what your character is, only then you will be able to enjoy it. You will notice time passing much faster when you are having fun. That is one reason why some players (probably) enjoy my server. You can just sink in random shit and have fun with random strangers. You can forget about your stupid life and be someone else, somewhere else, doing anything else!

I started playing RoR (let’s guess once again…) around 2014. I remember playing it with a friend back than. RoR was one of the first games that really got me into multiplayer sessions, even if I was mainly playing with my buddy. We drove with our Tatras on Desert Trails and that was honestly pretty much all. We only had a few default mods. Our spawn-able mods: Tatra Dakar, Agoras Buses, Daf Semi with two trailers; Our maps: Desert Trails and the two test terrains. That was all that we had, we didn’t know about mods at the beginning. We had a lot of fun anyway. We later used some old mods from the old repo on Penguinville. We both stopped playing after quite a few years. I don’t know why. Around 2019 I started to play the game once again, but with a whole bunch of mods and without my buddy… he had better things to do.
<br><br>
I had the feeling like RoR is missing a strong role-play-community. So I did it by my own. I started to read the docs on the official RoR website and set up the server. At the beginning of January 2021,  I decided to use the new server for the same purpose as today. I started off without anything. I created my first website with netlify and uploaded a placeholder for it. I had no staff, no players and just a placeholder index.html.
<br><br>
I began to met some random players on my server. Most just confused my server with official neo, but it was still nice for me. Some of the said players decided to come back. I thought that they might be able to watch the server while I am gone. I also wanted to share my work with others, so I gave away some moderator roles. I later found out about the official RoR discord server; My website was getting more and more content; I started getting ideas on how to recreate the GTA San Andreas server that I loved; I decided to make my own discord server.
<br><br>
I had to witness a lot of sad and angry players during the almost one year since I launched my server at the beginning of January. I should point out that I got really sick during the new year, so I was weak and mostly home. This is why I had so much free time to provide this server. I am still sick. It might be related to my mental health, maybe not. I am very stressed and scared, because of all the weird things that fucked me up since I made the server. It is not because of the server, it’s just how life decided to treat me. Some people are not very lucky. I am trying to stay strong and give my best for this server. It is one of the few things in my life, that made me proud and happy to be me.
<br><br>
I met many cool people and everyone was really helpful, whenever I needed anything. I cant express how happy I am about this fact. Once again: Thanks to everyone, from the bottom of my heart. I know that this whole server is edgy, childish and perhaps a very big waste of my money, but I still like it in here. Now we have our own forum and we will celebrate our first anniversary at the beginning of January. I am looking forward to many more fun moments on this server. I hope that I did not disgust anyone lol…
