More detailed information can be found in the documents included in the ZIP. Taken from ElevatorPitch.txt: Ok, so here's the lowdown: Drag race, F1 Test Track, classic muscle cars, running 'em stock. Single-elimination tournament style until we get a winner. Sound like fun? I've tested, retested, and tested again a set of muscle cars that I think will provide some interesting competition while potentially allowing players in a variety of cars do well. They run pretty close times, generally somewhere within the 15-17 second range on a solid run. No staging tree, no worries! We're going to throw it back old school: a 3-2-1-Go! countdown, and a finish line judge to determine the winner. (By the way: The amount of suggested players is really 16, but any number between 8 and 16 can work with some adjustment. I just had to enter 8 for the form to accept it.)

#### Rules 
Full rules can be found in the Rules.txt document contained in the ZIP. A quick summary is found below: - The event will be structured as a single-elimination tournament. Seed order will be determined by qualifying times. - Only the top 16 times will qualify. - Cars must be staged just before the starting line and at a standstill. - A 3s countdown starts each race. - The first to cross the finish line is the winner - Only cars on the list may be used, and must remain stock, as from repo/forum
