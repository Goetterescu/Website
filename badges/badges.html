<h2>Badges</h2>
<p>This page will introduce you to all the existing badges. You can earn badges by completing different tasks. Please dont ever beg for a 
badge, you will get it when you deserve it. Badges are brought to you by seasons. Seasons are sets of badges which will be different from the 
last one. Everyone can contribute and start his own season. Please contact Trucker_Gigi if you want to upload your own badges.</p>
