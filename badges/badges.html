<h2>Badges</h2>
<p>This page will introduce you to all the existing badges. You can earn badges by completing different tasks. Please don't ever beg for a 
badge, you will get it when you deserve it. Badges are brought to you by seasons. Seasons are sets of badges which will be different from the 
last one. Everyone can contribute and start his own season. Please contact Trucker_Gigi if you want to upload your own badges.</p>

These badges can be collected by Players by completing a practical exam under the eyes of an official driving instructor. Tier one are 
cars and small trailers with up to two axles. Tier two are smaller trucks and all buses. Tier three are big trucks which usually weight 
about 40-60 tons. These badges can be collected in any order, but a valid exam has to be done. 
The instructor will also have to proof this.</div><div class="box">
