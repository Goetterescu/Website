### Story:
The story is based on a squad of town people who got banned from their own families. The cause for the ban is the missing tolerance for people who are negotiating with merchants of other towns. The town of Zaahr has banned you and some of your friends for selling all of your belongings because you wanted to immigrate to the Royal City. The Royal City is the greatest place in all Alarm. The region has been named Alarm by the germans, who decided to give up the islands because of the dangerous Bandits who are currently taking over the no man’s land. It is unknown why and when the germans started to colonize this place, but it doesn’t matter. They will not come back anymore. It is currently not possible for any member of your caravan to go back to your home town.

#### Region:
The region is called Alarm. It is a collection of islands and pretty tropical, but rather dry in the west and south. Immigrants coming from all over the world are settled down in this region. The current year is 1400 AD.

#### Locations:
Falmar: A boring little town. It is has no real function and is being left alone by the Bandits. They are the main supplier of cotton (which is pretty useless in this region). They closed their borders to Zatar. It is only possible to come here from the Royal City or Zaahr.

Zatar: A messed up town which is also the most strict place in all Alarm. They do not allow their citicens to trade with merchants of other towns. The bandits have a close relation ship with Zatar. They are willing to trade with the people of Zatar, even if the elders of this town are not willing to allow this.

Zaahr: A good place for fishing. There is nothing else but fishing and a ferry which brings people to Zatar and Falmar. It should be pointed out that Zaahr is the only connection point between Zatar and Falmar, because of the closed borders.

The End:
It is just an unknown place, like the Royal City, the No Man's Land and the unknown Island. The Bandits are either trying to keep these places secret or no one has ever turned back from his journey to this places. No one knows.
