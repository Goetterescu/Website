#### Fighting:
The attacker has to do an attack roll. This is being done with the attack role dice of his class. After rolling he will have to check that with his targets Nat Def. The attacker will roll for damage if he hits. This is done with a preset dice, depending on the enemies difficulty, + Gear Damage. Here is an example:

Player attacking an goblin (difficulty dice is D8).
Goblin:

Nat Def: 10
Health: 12
Gear Armour: 2
Player:

Strength: 10
Gear Damage: 3
Attack roll: D8

He rolls for attack. D8+10 = 6+10

He scores 16, which is above 12 (Gear armour + nat def). So the player hits. He now calculates his damage.

His damage would be (10+3)-(10+2)+D8(In this case 5). So he deals 6 damage. The enemies health has been reduced to 6.

#### Other rolls:
Stats, class modifiers, items and much more will affect each roll. This means that every roll can be different. One player might only need an intelligence roll, others might have to roll for luck and strength. The Game master will tell you what to do.

#### Character creation:

Players will choose a class and add a total of five points to one of the stats (strength, intelligence, charisma and luck). The GM will keep track of your stats for you and maybe even do the calculations for damage and such.
