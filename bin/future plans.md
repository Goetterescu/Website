# Future Plans

## Move to github (done)
We will be moving the whole website to github and merge the two sides together.

## Communinity Event
Moderators will plan an Event and work on it with the squad.

## Remove the uc page and add a "news paper" page instead (done)
The user content page was not a greate idea. Let's try it with a more user friendly system.

### Map
This is my personal goal. I want to create a small map for us!
