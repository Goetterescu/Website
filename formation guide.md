# HTML strukture guide

## This guide helps contributers editing and creating pages for my website. 

### Headings
Headings are being used to give a describtion of a article in one or a few words. There are three "real headings": h1, h2, h3. 
The other heading, h4, is not a heading used for this purpose. It's a grey colored paragraph and can be used as a footnote. Quick example: After a video/image
you can give a sidenote and similar about the media using h4. In this case it should be centered above or below the embeded file.

- h1: The main [title](https://github.com/Goetterescu/Website/blob/main/Codes/Title%20and%20menu.html) of the website
- h2: For titles of the menu and pages
- h3: Title format for articles or important stuff

### Breakes
<hr> should be used after every article. Right at the end. It also comes after the first describtion of a page (below the paragraph which comes after h2).
<br> can be used if necessary. It is not being used after titles. After a title comes the paragraph and maybe another title. But no breake. 
It can be used to add some distance between a paragraph and a image. But not after a title and a image, or title and a table.

### Event pages
This is a different kind of page. It usually contains a long list of articles and should have a index. This will help visitors navigate through the page.
Here is a quick example on how a event page should be struktured. Note: This example is missing a bunch of things, it's supposed to be easy to read and wont function.
It also contains the articles which are neccesary for every event.

```
<embeded title and menu>
  <div auftl>
    <h2>Title of the event</h2>
    <p>Describtion<p>
    maybe some more content. breake might be required
    <hr>
    <h3>article 1</h3>
    <p>some info</p>
    <br>
    <img/>
    maybe h4 centered below it
    <hr>
    <h3>rules</h3>
    a list of rules
    <hr>
    <h3>moderators</h3>
    info for mods
    <hr>
    <h3>leaderboard</h3>
    <p>info</p>
    <h3>table</h3>
    <table>
    <p>more info</p>
    <hr>
    <h3>allowed vehicles and objects</h3>
    <list>
    
    Here comes the rest of the page.
 ```
