<h2>Factions</h2>
<p>Factions allow selected players to use special rights and locations.<br> 
If you want to become a member of a faction, you have to contact the head of the respective group.<br>If you want to create your own
faction, you have to contact the Project Leader Trucker_Gigi.<br>
Here's a list with all current factions:</p><br>

<h3>Truckers</h3>
<p>Why should someone join this Faction? It's simple: if you want to deliver goods to companies you have to take these from somewhere.
There are some Depots which buy and store goods. You can contact a Deposit to either deliver goods to them, store your current goods
or to take some from the respective Deposit and deliver them somewhere. All Truckers are freelancers, they're not working for some company
but you can make a contract with a Deposit and deliver freight for these.<br>
You like driving around with big rigs and 40 tons behind your cab? This is the right faction for you! Talk to the Leader and become
a part.

<h3>Public Services (unofficial)</h3>
<p>The biggest part of our community are the bus drivers, police officers and other people who are working for us - the people. <br>You may 
be thinking: <i>Why is there no real Faction for us? Why can't we have a list with members and a separate Faction for all of us?</i> The 
answer is quite simple: No one ever wanted to make a Faction. <br>Everyone can make his own Faction and hire people. 
You guys can have your bus Factions and stuff, just come to me and we'll do it. I'll not create Factions until we have some 
enthusiastic Leaders for them. The good thing about this: I'm saving myself a lot of time and every Player can start 
roleplaying right away. There is no need to be an official member or to be active every day. 
You can do whatever you want, whenever you want.
