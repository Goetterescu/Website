<newshead>An new Update for the News section</newshead>
<br><np>The News page looks different, doesn't it? Well, we did some changes. The old News section will be no more. You will now find a virtual 
Newspaper instead. This is it - the "Weekly Telegraph". You can inform yourself about this Newspaper on its own page and read the news on 
this one. Feel free to look around and contribute. It is very easy to get your own article uploaded. Just visit the info page of the Weekly 
Telegraph and learn how to contribute.<br>-Trucker_Gigi

<np>Starling Island is a place of "Terror and Grief". Most civilians have already left the city or even the island. The people of Starling 
Island are not happy with the infrastructure and the traffic. The local hospital is fairly big, but it does not have a trauma station. The 
emergency room is often forced to call for an helicopter to transport the victims of, what we call here, every-day-life to the university 
hospital many miles away. It is not safe on our island... <br>Are you considering leaving this place, too?</np>
