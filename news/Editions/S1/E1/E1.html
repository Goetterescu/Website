<newshead>A new Update for the News section</newshead>
<br><np>The News page looks different, doesn't it? Well, we did some changes. The old News section will be no more. You will now find a virtual 
news paper instead. This is it - the "Weekly Telegraph". You can inform yourself about this News paper on its own page and read the news on 
this one. Feel free to look around and contribute. It is very easy to get your own article uploaded. Just visit the info page of the Weekly 
Telegraph and learn how to contribute.<br>-Trucker_Gigi
