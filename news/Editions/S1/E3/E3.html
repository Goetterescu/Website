<newshead>No new Events for this month</newshead>
<br>
<np>The Staff will not supply any new Events to the community. We are currently busy with other things. Mainly the Moonshine Cup and real 
life work. But don't worry. We'll keep going next month!<br><br>

<newshead>Is the Highway too dangerous?</newshead>
<br>
<np>The administration of MitCity's infrastructure office is speechless. The amount of car accidents on the highway reached a new high. 
The major will be discussing with the city council if it's required to enforce new traffic restrictions, in order to reduce the amount of 
deadly car crashes. The emergency services are exhausted and the fundings for the hospital are reaching rock bottom. There will be further 
information during the upcoming week.<br>

<br>
<np>Get ready for the next week of the Moonshine Cup! It will take place on the Grunwaldring (28-29/08) and every driver or spectator is 
very welcome. The server will not be password protected and we will not use "any"-map. Our Moderator and paparazzi Xploder will be active 
and taking screenshots for the report. The report will be a summary which contains everything that players who missed the event need to know.
The script (also known as the Eventpage) will be updated during the upcoming week. So please expect finer tuning.<br><br>The Staff has started 
to work on two new Events. One tuners race and an rpg session (something like DnD but with simpler rules). The work on those Events will be continued 
next month.</np>

<div class="item5">
<newshead>Need Insurance?</newshead>
<br>
<np>You are usually roleplaying the trucker-role? Are you sick of traffic violation points? <br>I can help you out with that!<br>
Contact me on discord or the forum and I will be your lawyer and take care of all your traffic violation reports (exaggerated)! The only 
downside: You need to be on duty and a insurance number from me. I will only charge you 100 Gigi's per case!<br><br>
