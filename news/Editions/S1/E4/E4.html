<newshead>City Council Worried over Public Transportation Situation</newshead>
<br>
<np>In our last trend report, we noted how public transportation usage and volunteers have rapidly declined in MitCity. Most visitors and residents prefer to use their own vehicles than to use services such as city buses and taxis. And with almost no pedestrians, visitors are less likely to volunteer as city bus or taxi drivers. As a result, city council worries that our public transportation system is on the brink of falling apart. To aid with this, we will continue to advocate for more visitors to choose walking the streets rather than using cars. Also, we are in talks with Beholder Corporation to consider installing an automated bus system, similar to the Castle-Coldwater Shuttle that was implemented in North St. Helens. We look forward to progress on the situation, and hope that you can play a part in reviving our transportation system too!

<newshead>Boom in Housing Purchases and New Rumors!</newshead>
<br>
<np>At MitCity Housing Authority, we are pleased to see the increase in recent housing purchases. With all of the many options for housing available, we have something to fit everyone's needs. Some have chosen well-furnished town houses, while others have opted for simpler apartment dwellings. No matter the choice, MitCity Housing Authority is proud to have served the residents so well.
<br>
On a different note: our man in the street has gotten word of an oncoming gang war in MitCity. Some say it's a scheme by the nefarious Major to lower the prices of houses in the more expensive neighborhoods. Whatever the case, we will endeavor to keep a close eye on how things unfold.
