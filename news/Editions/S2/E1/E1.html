<newshead>Good Noodles</newshead>
<br><np>Our active Players and those who are contributing to our community are being rewarded with so called good noodles. These virtual stickers are one of two ways to stick out from the rest. The other way would be, by getting as many badges as possible. Badges are similar to good noodles, but they are being displayed on the credits and donations page. They are also rare and limited to certain Events and achievements. Our long-time-members Xploder and Pixel are the players with the most noodle stickers.

<br><np>The Moonshine Cup has started its second round. Everyone is very welcome to contribute or participate at the Event. Players can also spectate the Event, as long as they're not spawning mods during races. The open track day from last weekend was a good opportunity to learn the track.

<newshead>The Government goes nuts!</newshead>
<br><np>The property prices in MitCity have reached rock bottom. The average price for a three bedroom apartment near the city center has dropped from a stable 2,8k Gigis to almost 800 Gigis. The Police of MitCity stated that the reason for this depreciation is most likely the heated relation between some of the Gangs around the city. This affects the mood and safety of most property owners around the members-street and therefore, results in more and more houses for sale. The major did not respond to this situation yet and the city government seems to have accepted the current situation as is. The people of MitCity are shocked by this pathetic reaction and demand peace in their very own city.
