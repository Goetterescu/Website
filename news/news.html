<np>The Moonshine Cup week is over! Thanks to everyone who joined in and/or helped us out. We had a lot of fun. We are now looking forward to a "Weekend Trip". This will be a very casual "Event". A rural map, on which we will vote on our 
Discord server, will be used for this weekend. We are looking forward to casual role playing and mini events, as well as other unexpected things (this server is known for being random). Our Event Manager, Xploder, will be posting more 
information over this week. Stay tuned!

We might create our own Forum. Please contact any moderator of our squad, if <i>you</i> want to have a word or share your suggestions about this. The currency-update has been around for a short while now and we are still not sure about 
it. We might use a different bot, a website or other service to keep track of our virtual money. Suggestions are always very welcome. <br>The Staff will be taking a break for personal problems. Don't worry, we will be trying to keep 
our fan-base interested by doing what we are known for: random role playing sessions over the week and mini events during the weekend. We are very thankful for every single player, who decided to give our little community a try. And of 
course, we are even more thankful for everyone who is still here, thanks for sharing this great experience with us! Also: we will have our first anniversary in a few months, I still can't believe that I managed to gather so many 
people on my server. I guess that I will stay for a little longer than expected...<br>

--> We are back in Mitcity. Truckers are advised to not use the Highway, because of the narrow entrance and driving instructors will start teaching once again.<br>
--> The Department of Traffic and Safety (DOTAS) has tested the Scania which is mainly used by Trucker_Gigi. The test has been done with a similar model and was focused on general safety of the Truck. A report will be published soon.<br>
--> Drivers should watch for speed cameras which will be installed in small car trailers and placed next to the main roads. But here is a hot deal: Trucker_Gigi will take care of your speeding violations for only 200 Gigis per case!<br>
<br>That's it for this week. Remember to check out the sub-page of the DOTAS if you want to know more about traffic.<br><img class="center" src="../Index/Companies/DOTAS/test2/back1.png" width="80%">
