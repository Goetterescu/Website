<newshead>An new Update for the News section</newshead>
<br><np>The News page looks different, doesn't it? Well, we did some changes. The old News section will be no more. You will now find a virtual 
Newspaper instead. This is it - the "Weekly Telegraph". You can inform yourself about this Newspaper on its own page and read the news on 
this one. Feel free to look around and contribute. It is very easy to get your own article uploaded. Just visit the info page of the Weekly 
Telegraph and learn how to contribute.<br>-Trucker_Gigi

<np>Starling Island is a place of "Terror and Grief". Most civilians have already left the city or even the island. The people of Starling 
Island are not happy with the infrastructure and the traffic. The local hospital is fairly big, but it does not have a trauma station. The 
emergency room is often forced to call for an helicopter to transport the victims of, what we call here, every-day-life to the university 
hospital many miles away. It is not safe on our island... <br>Are you considering leaving this place, too?</np>

<div class="item5">
<newshead>Looking for a new job?</newshead>
<br><np><i>You want to be a free man? Want to drive a truck? Want to help others?</i> That's good, because we are looking for you!<br>
We are currently hiring new ambulance drivers and paramedics. Paramedics are working on a "free schedule", which means that they are not bond 
to a time plan. You can work whenever you want to. You will even get paid by the hour. Visit our hospital and jump in your very own car! 
Just use the -acmedic command and off you go. You will earn 30 Gigis per hour and the respect of a whole nation. Try it, it's worth it!</np>
