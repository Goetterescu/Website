<newshead>Toxic waste spill in Baker Ranch</newshead>
<br>
<np>
Local trucker Gigi was transporting some hazardous waste products from the nuclear power plant, when disaster struck! According to the driver, an estimated 1000 liters of nuclear waste was dumped into the sea after Gigi lost control along the highway and overturned the truck and its load.
<br><br>
"Yeah, you should [probably] not swim in there for the next 5000 years," Gigi told reporters.
<br><br>
Unfortunately, local resident verkan ended up in contact with the contaminated water after they got intoxicated with some homemade liquor. Verkan initially refused medical treatment, claiming that they were "just a bit sober" when the medic found him staggering down the highway. Eventually medical personnel, wearing hazmat suits, were able to convince him to come into the ambulance for medical examination. They were on their way to a hospital in town, when they realized... Baker Ranch has no hospital. Quickly the medic changed plans and requested an airlift by local helicopter pilot Pixel to MitCity Hospital, where Verkan could be better taken care of.
<br><br>
Pixel quickly lifted off and was on en route to MitCity, but the medic reminded him that the Coast Guard had a large medical ship less than 5 miles away from Baker Ranch which could prove more convenient. The experienced doctor and nurses swiftly received the patient for examination, then came back in a few minutes with the following report:
<br><br>
"Somehow the contamination didn't negatively affect him much. We're not quite sure how that happened, to be honest. We did give him something for an upset stomach though, so he should be alright for now."
<br><br>
With both pilot and medic satisfied with that response, the question remained of how they would get back to Baker Ranch. Pixel was ready to fly back in his Hughes 500D, but the captain generously offered to take the ship back near the coast. The captain may have been a bit too eager however, as he pushed the huge ship to full throttle and sped along at nearly 60mph. Those speeds were enough to nearly blow the helicopter off the ship altogether, so Pixel quickly took flight to avoid a salty bath and flew back on his own.
<br><br>
We are thankful to Baker Ranch's volunteer medical staff, as well as the Coast Guard medical ship, which in making its way towards the coast somehow dispersed the nuclear waste well enough to bring contamination down to a much safer level.

<newshead>New favorite map?</newshead>
<br>
<np>We decided to use Baker Ranch as the current regular map. Players reported that the new map is great for trucking. It is also big enough 
for roleplaying and the local highway creates a lot of ... interesting traffic situations, as seen in the image below. This is why I decided 
to use this map on a more regular base. Thanks to everyone who joined us during the casual role playing sessions or the event!<br>

<newshead>Event News</newshead>
<br>
<np>Moonshine Cup weekends are the longest weekends in the universe. They usually extend themselves over two to four weeks, but we are okay with 
that. The second weekend of the Moonshine Cup is the biggest event we ever had on this server. The players had multiple days to set their times 
for the Cup or free-roam on the track with any vehicle. We even had some smaller semi-casual events during the main event. Thanks to the whole 
Staff and every member of the gang, who decided to join in and contribute to this great experience. We all had a lot of fun!</np>

<np>The police department of Baker Ranch is asking everyone who's using the highway, to not speed. There is no speed limit 
on the highway itself, but the sand pit, which separates the highway from the regular road (near the trailer park) can surprise inexperienced 
drivers and result in serious accidents. Also: please note that the speed limit outside of cities and towns has been reduced to 100 km/h.<br>

<newshead>Server Updates</newshead>
<br><np>
Trucker_Gigi is currently working on a test try for the "currency-update". This update will add a virtual currency and bank accounts for 
every player. This way, players can do virtual deals with a virtual currency. There is no other information about this test. It is not known 
if he is going to launch the update someday, or not.<br>The regular map for the next days and perhaps weeks is baker ranch.<br>
Some pages of the website will be edited and optimized over the next few days.<br>A super-secret update is coming up!
