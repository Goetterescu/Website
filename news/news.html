<newshead>The Mayor lends a hand</newshead>
<br>
<np>Trucker_Gigi took an active share in the community this week, volunteering as a police officer in addition to being a trucker. It's always nice to have him stop by and check on the citizens, but this week he was able to arrange things so he could stay and help or much longer than usual. The residents of MitCity certainly seemed to appreciate his extended tenure as a fellow working resident of the city. Gigi expressed a desire to try it again sometime, so residents may get to interact with the mayor more in the near future.</np>

<newshead>A mansion party?! The Mayor approves.</newshead>
<br>
<np>Mayor Gigi, as the occupant of the luxurious mansion near the center of town, saw fit to invite his citizens over and have a party. Local resident verkan brought several dozen cases of beer, from which point things started to get strange. There was music, drifting, and extreme car stacking all in the same courtyard. The police department sent over an officer to check out complaints of excessive moise and reckless activity there. However, since Gigi was the mayor (and their boss), the officer decided to just not question these questionable activities and went on his way. He later returned with one of his civilian vehicles and somehow became the base for another car stack, as pictured. Once the mayor announced that he had to leave, police were back on the scene to make sure everyone else left the mansion, as it is private property that requires an invitation from Gigi to enter. All in all, the residents seemed to enjoy the impromptu parties and the shenanigans that went along with them.</np>

<newshead>Traffic News Bulletin</newshead>
<br>
<np>PSA: Due to a recent string of semi truck wrecks on the southern exit to the highway, the Department of Transportation strongly recommends that truckers instead use the more accessible northern exit. This will aid in decreasing accidents, although truckers should nevertheless continue to take caution. BTL ยง7 instructs truckers to maintain the rightmost lane on the highway. BTL ยง29, drafted and approved in a recent council meeting, additionally restricts vehicles and combinations weighing more than 8 tons to a highway speed limit of 50mph (80kph). Following these laws will help ensure the safe transportation of goods on MitCity's highway system.</np>

<newshead>"Choccy milk" <i>doesn't</i> make pain go away</newshead>
<br>
<np>Local driver Manieczek decided to attempt a somewhat offbeat transport job of filling a tanker with chocolate milk and bringing it back for downtown distribution. Since the police department had a lack of work for its officers, Manieczek decided to request an escort for his chocolatey expedition. Eager for a job, 4 officers immediately volunteered to help with the escort. The local police department noted that only 1 or 2 officers were needed, and too many officers were present. They reasoned that the excess cars could cause a traffic headache instead of clearing the way. Thus, they directed that some officers would need to abandon the escort and return for other assignments. There was one problem: None of the officers wanted to leave. After some negotiation, the police department decided to allow all of the officers to escort the truck, as long as they all stayed in one lane to avoid blocking other traffic. The escort safely made it to the impromptu chocolate milk filling station along the highway. The ride was short-lived, however, as the truck and trailer somehow tipped over not long after filling up and heading out on the highway again. The wreck spilled an abundance of chocolate milk all over the highway and required major cleanup. The trucker, devastated by his misfortune and failure to deliver chocolate milk to the masses, abandoned trucking for some time. Although he was somewhat disappointed with how his first try went, Manieczek expressed a willingness to try again someday to transport chocolate milk for MitCity's residents to enjoy.</np>

<newshead>Trends for the week</newshead>
<br>
<np>This week seemed to be filled with various activities around the city. The Gasway in town was popular as always, serving many vehicles around town with self-service fuel pumps (although very few people opted to step inside the srore for snacks and beverages). Stormark Repair was busy this week as well, as their expertise with a variety of damaged vehicles helped drivers get back on the road safely and quickly. Oddly enough, MitDonald's didn't seem to be quite as popular of a stop lately, probably due to a staffing shortage. Even the MitCity Mall, one of the most well-built establishments and highlights of the city, has unfortunately been empty for most of this past week. It seems that most places that require walking have become unpopular, as most residents prefer to drive their own vehicles around instead. This lack of foot traffic has caused public transportation services to become somewhat unpopular as well, since little to no pedestrians are available to transport to and from various locations in the city. Visitors are more than welcome to travel the city on foot to fully take in the sights and interesting destinations that can be found here. That is one trend we would like to see more of in the future, to help boost activity around town. We wish you all the best and a pleasant stay in our fair city!
