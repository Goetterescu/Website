<h2>Donations and special thanks</h2>
<p>So as you may know, I'm paying the gameserver myself. Also I am the creator of this website. 
I would be really glad if some of the players
could help me out and maybe donate something for this project. Notice: I will not use any of the donations to buy something for myself. 
I will invest it into this project, so you can have more fun!<br><br></p><h3 style="text-align:center">Here is the link to 
my <a href="https://paypal.me/pools/c/8vUENexckD">Moneypool</a></h3><br><p>I am thankfull for any help that i get. Even if you are not donating,
but you're just playing on my gameserver, editing something for me, translating my site, or anything else. Thanks to all my players.</p>

<h3>Special thanks:</h3>
<p>Here is a list with all the people I'm really thanking from the bottom of my heart:</p>
<ul>

<br><li><p style="color:red">Willy</p>You're helping me with RoR-Bot and other things, I'm glad to have an experienced Player by my side. And thank you for 
being so nice to the whole RoR community.</li>
<br><li><p style="color:red">Tritonas</p>You took a lot of your free-time to help me out with my Server, 
even though that's none of your business. Thank you for that and thank you for supplying us with the content we love.</li>
<br><li><p style="color:red">Xploder</p>There's not much to say. You keep on helping me and the whole community.

<h3>Badges:</h3>
<p>Badges show what each Player managed to achieve on this roleplay server. Badges can both honor and dishonor Players. 
They are given to <u>active</u> Players. But you guys can also submit new badges. Badges come in seasons (sets). 
<a href="badges.html">Here is the wiki for them</a>.
