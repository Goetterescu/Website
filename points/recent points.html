<h1>Recent Violations</h1>
<p>Quick summary of this system: Police officers can report other Players using the form. The form will be handled by Moderators and the 
result will be posted here, but only if they approved the report. Moderators have to state every penalty here. Proof images or videos have 
to be included if there are any. Moderators have to update the table on the main page of this system, too.</p>

<br><h3>Protocol:</h3>
<p>The first suspect, Pixel, caught my attention when he overtook me by driving off the road to my right hand side. He later stopped when I 
flashed my lights on him. He even pulled up, so I will only request two points. The second suspect almost killed me and another police officer 
while entering the town with extreme speed. He seemed to have tried to steer away from me or the police bmw. This resulted into him crashing 
into a bus stop. He could have hurt or even killed multiple people, just because of his reckless driving (&sect;18). Pixel stated that he tried 
to escape from someone, but I am not sure if that's an excuse or not. He did not hesitate to pass me on the roadside.

<br><h3>Protocol:</h3>
<p>The suspect was about to do an illegal street race. He blocked the traffic and was heading into the wrong direction (I will not fine the 
suspect for facing the wrong way while stationary). He might have launched facing the wrong way, but I don't have any proof for that. He 
did not move his vehicle off the road when I asked him to do so. I am requesting one point for each infraction.

<br><h3>Protocol:</h3>
<p>&sect;1 of the public transit guideline has not been respected by the suspect. He blocked the traffic flow and caused me, who was on duty 
during an emergency, to stop and to drive onto the sidewalk in order to get past the taxi. The taxi seemed to be not used and the suspect was 
most likely not near the unmanned vehicle. The suspect risked the life of other people and blocked the traffic flow. I am requesting one point for 
each infraction.
