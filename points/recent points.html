<h1>Recent Violations</h1>
<p>Quick summary of this system: Police officers can report other Players using the form. The form will be handled by Moderators and the 
result will be posted here, but only if they approved the report. Moderators have to state every penalty here. Proof images or videos have 
to be included if there are any. Moderators have to update the table on the main page of this system, too.</p>

<br><h3>Protocol:</h3>
<p>The suspect has been stopped by me after I noticed his combination. He clearly overloaded his trailers and truck (which is not visible in the proofs). See the first three 
    Images as proof for that. I suspect that the loads were not secured properly (&sect;20). The loads are facing in slightly different ways and are obviously 
    laying at different angles (see Image number five). The trailer seems to be damaged as well, the bed seems to be bend. This is why I am requesting 
    &sect;11 (&sect;10.5 and &sect;10.9 of the VCG). I am requesting two points for overloading the combination (&sect;18, proof seen in Image number four), two points for using 
    a damaged trailer (&sect;11) and one more point for not securing the loads (&sect;20).
