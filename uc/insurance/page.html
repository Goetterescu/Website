<br><p>
Our insurance policy is simple and effective. Our clients can savor the best possible service there is. We know how hard every day work is 
for our fellow Taxi drivers and EMS personnel. They are asked to speed even if it's not safe to do so. And we also know who cares when they 
crash or get a ticket: no one. We are here to change this unfair system. Sign up for one of our two services and we will take care of your 
traffic infractions!** Contact Trucker_Gigi if you want to sign up for our Insurance service.
