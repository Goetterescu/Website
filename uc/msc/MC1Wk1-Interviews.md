### Gigi's Interview


**Xploder98 (X): Okay, first: As the series director, would you view this first event as a success?**

**Gigi (G):** We had quite some trouble getting players motivated for the event, but I think that we all managed to create a vibe for it. So it should work better from now on.

&nbsp;

**X: Next question: Could you explain a little about how you ended up with a DNF for the Three-Round Race? What caused it?**

**G:** Another player spawned a complex vehicle just before i turned in for the last long turn. This caused me to wreck my car and so the race was over for me. We tried to prevent such situations and we failed. We will do better by using a password for the next event

&nbsp;

**X: Okay, thanks. Were you expecting a little more diversity in driver car choice? It seemed like most drivers stuck to the MeanMachine Race.**

**G:** People will choose what's best for them. The MeanMachine is easy to handle. On the other side the Lotus can be the quicker choice, but you have to learn how to control it. I think that Pixel tried that once or twice during the weekends, but he still used the MM.

&nbsp;

**X: How do you feel about placing 3rd in the Moonshine Cup overall standings?**

**G:** I'm satisfied with it.

&nbsp;

**X: Alright, thank you. I think that's all of the questions I had for you, so your answers are very much appreciated.**

**G:** You're welcome and thanks.

&nbsp;

### Pixel's Interview


**X: First: How does it feel to have swept qualifying, Single-Round Race, and Three-Round Race in the very first event of the Moonshine Cup?**

**Pixel (P):** It feels great but a bit boring since I didn't have much competition for a while; the only way I could've lost was by crashing which didn't happen.

&nbsp;

**X: I see, thanks. What are your thoughts on [what looks like could be] the next Moonshine Cup venue, the Grünwaldring? Are you looking forward to racing there, or are you a bit wary?**

**P:** Well, I absolutely love driving there, but the MeanMachine is suited for high speed corners; on slower turns it has no grip and would be quite atrocious to drive there. Also, it doesn't have the best brakes.

&nbsp;

**X: What are your thoughts on Zurkhal, our newcomer who proved himself to be very quick in a racecar? Do you feel like he poses a threat for the Moonshine Cup lead?**

**P:** I like the guy, and he is indeed a good driver. Later after the race we decided to just hotlap on the track and he was able to beat my 59.8 with a 59.3. There'll certainly be some good battles between the two of us.

&nbsp;

**X: And we'll certainly be looking forward to watching that fight unfold. It was unfortunate that Gigi DNF'ed in the Three-Round Race. However, based on his other results, do you think Gigi is another fast driver to watch out for?**

**P:** I certainly think he could be, especially after I shared two of my tricks that Zurkhal was able to use and improve so much. I wouldn't be surprised if Gigi could do the same.

&nbsp;

**X: Hmm, interesting. One final question: Could you tell us a little about what it's like to both race and help keep order around the track at the same time?**

**P:** Luckily it isn't too much of a hassle. I can get my laps done while Gigi is keeping track then we can switch places, works itself out most of the time.

&nbsp;

**X: I see. Well thank you very much for your responses, and I'm looking forward to next round. Hopefully I can take the fight to you, Gigi, and Zurkhal then!**

&nbsp;

### RamCharger's Interview

**X: Can you remember what caused you to DNF in our race together and maybe describe it a little bit?**

**RamCharger (RC):** So what happened was: My front left wheel hit the wall and had a seizure, then I couldn't really move [the car] at all.

&nbsp;

**X: Oh, I see. And how do you feel about placing 6th in the overall standings?**

**RC:** I feel good. Feels good to be somewhere at least.

&nbsp;

**X: One last question: Who do you think is in the best position to win the Moonshine Cup right now?**

**RC:** I dunno.

&nbsp;

**X: It is kind of hard to tell at this point, isn't it? Well, thank you for your time and your responses.**

&nbsp;

### Carteirrrr's Interview

**X: You posted some pretty solid laptimes and got 5th place overall in the event. Are you planning to take part in the next event [which currently looks like it will be held] at Grünwaldring?**

**Carteirrrr (CT):** Maybe.

&nbsp;

**X: I see. If you did join, how much practice do you think you would need in order to do fast laps?**

**CT:** Probably a lot.

&nbsp;

**X: Hmm. Okay, well one last question: who do you think is in a good position right now to win the Moonshine Cup?**

**CT:** Uhh Pixel, I guess.

&nbsp;

**X: OK, thanks for your responses!**

&nbsp;

### Zurkhal's Interview

**X: How does it feel to place 2nd in the overall standings within just a day of joining the Moonshine Cup?**

**Zurkhal (ZK):** It feels great! However I do have to say, I feel bad for the other racers that finished after me on the 3 lap race, as they didn't finish any lap whatsoever, thus affecting their average position in the leaderboards. I hope they can redeem themselves on the next race!

&nbsp;

**X: Very good response, thank you. Next question: Do you think you can compete with Pixel for event wins going forward?**

**ZK:** I hope so, haha! He's a very talented driver indeed! Moreover, I never thought I would find someone being fast on a soft-body physics game at all, since it is a tad difficult, especially using a keyboard!

&nbsp;

**X: How much preparation do you think you might need to be competitive at [what is shaping up to be] our next venue, Grünwaldring?**

**ZK:** To put it short? Tons of practice! I got the map only yesterday I believe, so that'll be the main thing to do to get ready. Explore the track and get a consistent, good racing line. I'm sticking with the 400 LS; I know it very, very well by now. But if the Lotus is used instead, I'm going to crash a lot of them into walls to learn how to drive it, heh!

&nbsp;

**X: I see. Thank you for your time and all of your great responses!**

**ZK:** And thank you for the interview!
