Today we had to witness a very damaged truck just outside of north-mitcity. The cause of the wreck is and might remain unknown. Police forces arrived 
after a "long wait" because of the high rate of criminality. Luckily the driver was not injured. His rig is totaled and the trailer can't be used anymore. 
It is unknown why the driver decided to drive his combination in such a overloaded condition. He was not fined but had to remove the damaged combination by 
his own. No further information avabil.
