<h2>User content</h2>
<p>This page is dedicated to my Players. Everyone can submit a page either via Discord or the Forum and I will publish it. 
Examples for such submits are ads, announcements for closed or user made Events, parts for your rp life (articles like "most wanted"-lists 
or "I'm selling ...") and screenshots or videos of your virtual life on my Server. Please note that I'll need some time to check your 
submissions.</p>

<h3>FAQ:</h3>
<ul>
<li><u>How can I submit a page?</u><br>
Two options, but remember that I prefer the first one. In both cases you should use Discord or the RoR Forum.<br>Option 1: Send me a HTML file. You can write a page using Word if you don't know 
how to write codes. Simply safe it as a HTM or HTML.<br>Option 2: Send me a text message containing all the details about your page and 
I will write and upload it for you.<br>You can also use our <a href ="uc sub.html">Form</a> to submit a request.</li><br>

<li><u>How long will my page be available for other Players?</u><br>
As long as you wish. But usually I will let it rest for three days and notify you before I delete it.</li><br>

<li><u>What should I submit? Do you need a HTML-file?</u><br>
A fully coded webpage would be great. You can use Word to write a website and safe it as a HTM or HTML-file. 
This would safe me a lot of time, because I would not have to write the page by myself. But you can try your luck & charisma on me and I 
MAY create the page for you.</li><br>

<li><u>What content is not allowed?</u><br>
Things that are out of the server, like real objects for sale, should not be promoted. Also please don't submit offensive articles. 
Roleplaying (Gangs for example) is an exception. We are an uncensored community after all.</li>
